### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cem. I am a Unity Developer.

#### ðŸ”­ Work 

* Iâ€™m currently working on [TFM: The First Men](https://store.steampowered.com/app/700820/TFM_The_First_Men/) |Mostly UI, tool and gameplay programming as Unity Developer.
* I'm developer of [Village Defence](https://cemuka.github.io/pinuscraft/village-defence.html).

#### ðŸŒ± Hobbies 

I invest my free time on research about several topics. 
##### TCP network

Network is a big one, such a long quest(much xp). From protocols to hardware, I found it hard to step in and it may require a long journey to master your knowledge. My experience is a slice of thin experience at software layer.

Learning bits and pieces of C# sockets was challenging and with lots of failure, I managed myself to complete a TCP networking library for unity with a simplifying mind, as much as I can.

But later I spend my time mostly on popular network libraries for unity. I played around with mostly [Telepathy](). Its the underlaying driver of [Mirror]() and it has such a high level control over c# sockets and carefully crafted. This time I mixed up telepathy with [MessagePack]() and with an easy chat app sample, Telegraph was created.

Also I buried a dozen hours on prototyping action rpg mechanics with these libraries like movement, skills and global events. But none of them came along with a concrete project. It would be a dream project for me to work on a classic mmorpg BUT as I dig in networking and architecture, impression of developing an online game is become huge walls over time to me. It would take years and years for a single developer to complete a standart mmorpg (assets, animations, ui, content, test etc).

Nevertheless, as I said above, networking is a long road. I will continue to take baby steps and keep making progress.

##### Tooling
